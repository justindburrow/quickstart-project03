This is a To Do List app with a contact page created for Quickstart Bootcamp Project 3.

This project allows a user to enter and manage items on a to do list.

This project was built using React and Vite and contains Javascript, HTML, and Css

This project could be improved in the future by saving a users to do list using the contact information, allowing useres to log in to access previous to do list, and adding a field to enter notes or more information about a to do list item.
